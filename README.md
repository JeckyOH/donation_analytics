NOTE:

1) In this challenge solution, I did not use any external package. Besides, I have made the codes compitable with Python2 and Python3. The only point is that, running run.sh in its own directory.

2) In this code challenge, I implemented both single thread method and multiple thread method. By default, I use single thread method because the situation is not suitable for multiple threads. Multiple threads interface is just for future scalable.
